# Orchestration State (authoritative resume anchor)

Mission: `sideout-perfection-orchestration-prompt.md` — make every component and route impeccable + land the section 10 grants. Autonomous; owner delegated approval to the agents (majority vote). Do NOT stop to ask.

- Branch: `polish/multiagent-burst`
- Started: 2026-07-08 ~07:10 PDT
- Resume cron: one-shot `c3bc54dd` @ 12:04pm PDT 2026-07-08 (session-only). On resume, schedule the next ~2h safety net before working.

## Phase tracker
- [x] Kickoff: read AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / globals.css; create /docs; seed ledger/decisions/reportcards/assets/tooling; record section 10 AGENTS.md amendments in Decision Log + edit AGENTS.md.
- [ ] Phase 0 (Leon + Lisa): quality-floor.md, acceptance.md, copy.md, metadata.md + Phase 0 report-card round to pass bar.
- [ ] Phase 1 (Jerry + Dave): implement fixes + boundaries/scripts/view-transition flag + report-card round.
- [ ] Phase 2 (Sierra): adversarial verify; loop to Jerry/Dave until acceptance all-pass + 3 gates green + Lighthouse >=90.
- [ ] Phase 3 (Thomas): CI gates, preview, production deploy (owner delegated the section 9 gate to agents).
- [ ] Final: before/after HTML breakdown of the product.

## Gates the Orchestrator runs itself after every phase
`npx tsc --noEmit` ; `next build` ; `node --test` — never trust a phase as done until green.

## Current position
Kickoff complete. NEXT: launch Phase 0 (Leon + Lisa in parallel via Workflow), then integrate + report cards.

## How to resume
Read this file, then handoff.md, then the orchestration prompt. Continue from "Current position". Keep this file + ledger.md + reportcards.md + handoff.md updated every step.
